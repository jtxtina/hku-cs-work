SVM Algorithm - Python

To run the code, directly run the code on jupyter notebook. Please put dataset folder and the code under the same directory.

    1. Assignment1.ipynb
    
       Datasets: breast cancer dataset & iris dataset in csv files
       Output: trained model and predictions
       Overview: Implement SVM algorithm to test on datasets provided.
     
    2. Packages
       The following packages are required:
           pandas --- only to load in data
           numpy
           cvxopt
           sklearn --- only to compare the outcome of my SVM with the library SVM in the end
